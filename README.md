# Summer school on modelling and complex systems 2021

**Acknowledgement**: This Summer school is partially funded by Science and research Fund at Sofia University (contract 80-10-189-27.04.2020). 

**Application**: Deadline for application is July 10, 2020 by filling-in this application form: [https://forms.gle/r1RAMQjYJqWaWDib9](https://forms.gle/r1RAMQjYJqWaWDib9). Only some applications would be approved. The approved will be notified by e-mail and will recieve hyperlink.

**Location**: Online in Zoom sessions (Aproved participants would receive hyperlink)

**Time**: July 18-26, 2020 

**Main objectives**:
* Creating an attitude for studying and applying scientific methods in research.
* Winning the hearts and minds of learners to apply the scientific method.
* Permanent change of students' attitudes.
* Upgrading the knowledge and skills for scientific work

**Concept**: Intensive training in methods (not so much applications) through lectures, workshops and team work on projects. 

**Cases**: As part of the Summer school the participants would have to solve and present a case, out of several options, which will be given on the first day. [See the cases here...](cases.md)

**Certification**: Certificates issued by Faculty of Economics and Business Administration will be issued to those who successfully pass the Summer school. The requirements are at least 70% active participation in the classes and participation in a team with a presented solution at the end. Participants who cannot take part fulltime can also join classes, but will not receive a certificate.

**Target audience**: PhD students in their first 18 months and advanced graduates (master students).  

**Official language**: For written materials - English, for lectures - Bulgarian or English.
